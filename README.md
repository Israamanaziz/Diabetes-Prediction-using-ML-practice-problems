# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ML-practice-problems
Practice project from Siddhardhan's ML Tutorial for Diabetes Prediction using SVM. For learning purposes only.

## INTRODUCTION
This is a machine learning practice project based on [Siddhardhan's yt tutorial for predicting diabetes](https://www.youtube.com/@Siddhardhan).
The aim is to understand how Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be applied to a classification problem while predicting a disease.

## DATASET USED
**Name**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

**SOURCE**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## Learning Outcomes
1) Data collection
2) Data preprocessing, Data Standardization
3) Splitting data into training and testing sets
4) Using svm classifier from scikit-learn
5) Building a basic predictive system
